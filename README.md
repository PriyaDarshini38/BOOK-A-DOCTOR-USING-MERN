Book a Doctor using MERN
Overview
Book a Doctor is an easy-to-use online platform that allows users to quickly and efficiently book doctor's appointments. Say goodbye to the hassle of traditional appointment booking! Our user-friendly interface lets users browse through a variety of doctors, filter based on specialties, locations, and availability, and book appointments with just a few clicks. The system provides real-time availability, making it simple to schedule appointments that fit into your busy life.

This platform is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for a seamless, responsive, and fast experience across both front-end and back-end.

Technical Architecture
This project follows a client-server model using the MERN stack. Below is a detailed overview of the technologies used:

Frontend:
React: The user interface is built using React, making it highly responsive and interactive.
Material UI & Bootstrap: These libraries are used to ensure a modern and user-friendly UI.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API, facilitating smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
Backend:
Node.js & Express.js: The backend uses Node.js for handling server-side logic and Express.js as a framework for routing and managing API requests.
MongoDB: The database used for storing user profiles, doctor information, appointment data, etc. MongoDB ensures scalability and efficient data storage.
Key Libraries and Tools:
Moment.js: To handle date and time functionalities, ensuring accurate appointment scheduling.
JWT (JSON Web Token): For secure user authentication and authorization.
